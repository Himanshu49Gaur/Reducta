# Reducta: GPU-Accelerated Parallel Reduction using CUDA

## 1. Problem Statement

As data-driven systems continue to scale in size and complexity, computational bottlenecks increasingly emerge in the process of **data reduction** — converting large datasets into meaningful scalar outputs such as sums, averages, or aggregated measures.  

Traditional **CPU-based sequential reduction** is inherently limited by its serial nature, leading to poor scalability and longer computation times. On the other hand, **Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)** provide a massively parallel architecture but require specialized algorithmic strategies to efficiently exploit their full computational potential.

The problem therefore lies in designing a **high-performance parallel reduction algorithm** capable of efficiently utilizing GPU resources while ensuring accuracy, synchronization, and scalability across diverse data sizes.

## 2. Objective

The objective of **Reducta** is to implement a **GPU-optimized reduction framework** using NVIDIA’s **CUDA** architecture. The primary aims include:

- Achieving significant speedup over traditional CPU-based reduction methods.  
- Utilizing **shared memory** and **synchronization mechanisms** to reduce memory access latency.  
- Demonstrating efficient **intra-block and inter-block reduction** with minimal divergence.  
- Establishing a scalable reduction framework adaptable to real-world, high-volume computational workloads.
